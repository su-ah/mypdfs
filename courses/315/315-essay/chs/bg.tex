\section{Prerequisite Algebra}

\subsection{Basic Group Theory}

\textcolor{green}{
groups, subgroups, normal subgroups, (high-level) quotient groups.
fields, sequences / trees of (sub)groups, solvable groups.
}

\subsection{name tba}

\textcolor{green}
{
connection between groups and (roots of) polynomials, field extensions,
automorphisms as permutations.
}

\textcolor{green}{
want to keep the ``algebra" approach to a minimum, preferring a high-level,
intuition-based story over a bunch of group theory theorems and terminology
where possible
