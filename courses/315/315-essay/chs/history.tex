\section{History}

\subsection{Existence}

\textcolor{green}{
short-ish stint about history of quadratic formula (pre-fta) and
fundamental theorem of arithmetic here.
antiquity of quadratic formula, fta first statements, early discussion,
who made attempts and when.
}

\subsection{Closed-form expressions}

\textcolor{green}{
history of motivation for cubic since its interesting,
key steps of derivations for lower deg polynomials.
particular attention/emphasis on the depressed and resolvent polynomials,
initial suggestions of inductive method
}

\subsection{Symmetry of roots}

\textcolor{green}{
focus on the ``symmetry" of the roots wrt permutation and how it shows up in
the above derivations.
discussion of how we could generalize to 5th degree, motivation for using
algebra
}
